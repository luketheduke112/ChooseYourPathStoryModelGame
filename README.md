Prototyping for future web game to be programmed in javascript.


UPDATE:
1/31/2020
I'm realizing that prototyping a javascript game in java is a 0/10 idea. But I already did it so screw it. Anyways this is a finished prototype so I did all the things I wished to accomplish. Next up I'm going to program the actual game. üëç 

That will be another repository on Github soon.
